			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface of 1848</h2>
			<p>I cannot forego my usual opportunity of saying farewell to my readers in this greeting-place, though I have only to acknowledge the unbounded warmth and earnestness of their sympathy in every stage of the journey we have just concluded.</p>
			<p>If any of them have felt a sorrow in one of the principal incidents on which this fiction turns, I hope it may be a sorrow of that sort which endears the sharers in it, one to another. This is not unselfish in me. I may claim to have felt it, at least as much as anybody else; and I would fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience.</p>
			<p><b>Devonshire Terrace</b>, Twenty-Fourth March, 1848.</p>
